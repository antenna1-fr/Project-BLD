# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Description for Open AI Codex

Project Bazaar Laplace's Demon (BLD) is a quantitative finance project dedicated to profit-maximised trading in the hypixel bazaar. The goal is to analyze signals from previous bazaar market data collection and apply/test it on later data. The analysis method will be machine learning, at least partially Reinforcement Learning trained on a trading simulator. The trading window is flexible, with anything between 4 hours and two weeks being valid for investment. In this repository, however, a much smaller dataset is used, in "smaller processed data.csv". Profit is the ultimate goal.

## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex
- "/Data" : Contains all input data
    - "/Processed" : Contains processed inputs (Note: Raw is not present due to size constraints)
- "Model Quality" : Debugging, testing, and evaluation outputs from ML models
- "Scripts" : Contains all computation scripts, including ML
- "Outputs" : Predictions returned by ML models
    - "Trading" : Trading predictions

## Conventions for OpenAI Codex
- Use Python for all generated code
- Remember the real dataset is much larger. Do not unnecessarily computationally overburden code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep variable names descriptive and meaningful at all times
- Scripts should provide user-readable summaries of results in addition to their outputs

## Pull Request Guidelines for OpenAI Codex

When OpenAI Codex helps create a PR, please ensure it:

1. Includes a clear description of the changes as guided by Agents.md
2. References any related issues that OpenAI Codex is addressing
3. Ensures all tests pass for code generated by OpenAI Codex
4. Keeps PRs focused on a single concern as specified in Agents.md

## Testing requirements

- Test scripts on the limited data in the repository
- Profit is the main testing indicator
- Sanity check all results

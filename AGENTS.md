# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Description for Open AI Codex

Project Bazaar Laplace's Demon (BLD) is a quantitative finance project dedicated to profit-maximised trading in the hypixel bazaar. The goal is to analyze signals from previous bazaar market data collection and apply/test it on later data. The analysis method will be machine learning, at least partially Reinforcement Learning trained on a trading simulator. The trading window is flexible, with anything between a day and two weeks being valid for investment. 

## Project Structure for OpenAI Codex
- "/Data" : Contains all input data
    - "/Processed" : Contains processed inputs (Note: Raw is not present due to size constraints)
- "Model Quality" : Debugging, testing, and evaluation outputs from ML models
- "Scripts" : Contains all computation scripts, including ML
- "Outputs" : Predictions returned by ML models
    - "Trading" : Trading predictions

## Conventions for OpenAI Codex
- Use Python for all generated code
- Keep variable names descriptive and meaningful at all times
- Scripts should provide user-readable summaries of results in addition to their outputs
